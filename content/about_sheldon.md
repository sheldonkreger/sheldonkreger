# Overview
I am a software engineer focused on applications in the big data space. Many other buzzwords might also describe my work, such as data engineer, data scientist, devops engineer, full stack developer, distributed systems engineer, systems analyst, and so on.

# Work
Being a healthy and generally well-educated individual is superior to being a one-trick, corporate code-writing machine. Society doesn't just need engineers, it needs engineers who insist on solving the problems which truly matter. Building foundations across many disciplines has given me the confidence to take a deep-dive when the requirement arises. 

Despite all the terminology, the important thing to know is that programming requires extraordinary intellectual flexibility. Rather than a boring list of technologies I've used, the emphasis ought to be on my personal attributes. By focusing on my physical and mental health, I am consistently able to achieve deep focus for many hours per day. Because I am not a 'naturally gifted' programmer, and because the technologies I find myself working with is in constant flux, I have focused on overall personality development over endless study of any particular technology. But, when the need arises, I am more than excited to learn the details and explore the depths of the best tools for whatever job I am facing.

The underlying constant in everything I do is the achievement of flow. My body is the lab and my lifestyle is the experiment. With experience, I make adjustments to the parameters with the goal of increasing my performance and the positive impact I have on society.

# Podcast
The urgent social and economic ramifications of big data technologies inspired me to start my podcast, "Big Data, Big Issues." There are few general rules which hold true when considering privacy, individual agency, national security, and corporate innovation. Instead, we must investigate specific technological innovations and choices in their broader ethical context. On the podcast, I try to explain the views of influential leaders objectively - often contrasting them against one antother - and then develop and explain my personal perspective. You can find it on your favorite platform like Spotify, Google Play, Google Podcasts, and many others. You can also find a full episode list on the [Big Data Big Issues website.](https://bigdatabigissues.com)

# Other
Strength training provides the foundation upon which I enjoy many outdoor sports, including ski/snowboarding, hiking, sprinting, paintball, and downhilll mountain biking. I have a home studio where I record drums and compose music of many genres. Economics, environmental sciences, psychology, psychoanalysis, and critical theory are topics I take seriously and have been obsessed with at one point or another. Visual artwork and fashion is fascinating to me, particularly techwear and surrealism. I have been practicing Transcendental Meditation since 2009.
