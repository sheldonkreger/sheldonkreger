This week, the Mormon church announced that it would discriminate against the children of same sex couples.

As an individual who proudly left the church at age 14, I not surprised about the recent changes in LDS stance toward homosexuality. What I am surprised about is the reaction of my liberal minded friends and family to these changes.

Rather than discussing the fundamental problems of the LDS church and religion in general, we have been distracted by the admittedly outrageous decisions they have made about the fine print details of homosexuality and the LDS religion. While this particular policy is undoubtedly deplorable, we need to ask ourselves WHY these people feel GOOD about making this decision.

The underlying issue is that faith based organizations like the LDS church do not use logic or reason when they make decisions. They instead make up whatever rules fit most conveniently into their faith and the political atmosphere at any given point in time. Because faith based practices are not accountable to objective truth, there is no real boundary on the harm they can inflict on themselves and others in society.

When the foundation of your morality is separated from logic and reason, it becomes habitual to deny truth when it is presented in front of you, simply because it contradicts your faith. It also makes it easy to become hateful and (as history has repeatedly shown) violent against people who disagree with you. The more evidence there is that a faith based belief is incorrect, the more resistance we see from the believers.

Rather than focusing on the particular details of today's hot news item, we should use it as an opportunity to promote critical thinking about the relationship between morality, truth, reason, and belief. Any philosopher, theologian, or ethicist will certainly remind us that there are no easy answers, but that the consequences of our beliefs have an immeasurable impact on our lives.
